The following Dockerfile has been prepared for the application from the test task

# Optimize this variant

FROM ubuntu:18.04 
COPY ./src /app 
RUN apt-get update -y 
RUN apt-get install -y nodejs 
RUN npm install 
ENTRYPOINT ["npm"] 
CMD ["run", "prod"] 

# A better option is:

FROM node:14-slim 
WORKDIR /usr/app
COPY package.json /app
RUN npm install 
CMD ["node", "src/app.js"]  # assume running apps without npm | study case: current HR project
